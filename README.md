**Retail Orders Analysis Project**

Overview

This project is dedicated to performing an in-depth analysis of retail orders. The process begins with data acquisition from Kaggle datasets via their API, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the retrieved data. Modifications are made to the dataset to prepare it for deeper analysis, which is then conducted using a PostgreSQL database. The analytical phase involves advanced SQL queries, including Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions to derive insights about monthly sales performance across different product categories.

Project Workflow
1. Data Acquisition
* Source: Data is pulled from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
* Details: Ensure you have the appropriate API credentials and access rights to pull the retail order datasets.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Tools Used: Python, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for visualizations.
* Process:
    * Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
    * Performing initial data cleaning and preprocessing.
    * Analyzing distributions, correlations, and summarizing key statistics.

3. Data Preparation
* Objective: Refine and transform the data for detailed analysis.
* Details:
  * Handling missing values and outliers.
  * Feature engineering to enhance the dataset.
  * Exporting the cleaned DataFrame to a PostgreSQL database.

4. Data Analysis in PostgreSQL
* Database Setup: Connect to PostgreSQL database.
* Advanced SQL Techniques:
* CTEs: Used for structuring complex queries and improving readability.
* Window Functions: Employed to perform calculations across sets of rows related to the current row.
* Analysis Goal: Determine which month and category combination yields the highest sales.

**Prerequisites**
* Python 3.x
* Pandas and SQLAlchemy libraries
* PostgreSQL server
* Kaggle API credentials
